# MyWordS
In last semester my course partner and I wrote a memorizing software WordSet which too rough to satisfy even myself. It was done in a quite tight time schedule. And I wasn't able to did my best on it. I'm feel so sorry for showing this unpleasant final product infront of all you guys. Now, since I've had my master offer, I think I finally have time to redo the project.

I've conceived some features like below:

**BASIC**
- [ ] A basic UI.
	- [ ] word decks: decks browse
- [ ] Adding a new word with: meaning, example sentence (optional).
- [ ] A word is binded with: familiarity(depend on memorization check result), importance(manually set).
- [ ] Word decks. You put words sharing a common point in a word deck.
- [ ] Randomly check memorization.

**ADVANCED**
- [ ] Wordle
- [ ] Extract sentence from cursor. Compare with words and automatically add to word's example sentence.
- [ ] Better UI
	- [ ] smoother angles
	- [ ] transition animation
	- [ ] transparent buttons
	- [ ] add icons for buttons
- [ ] customizable beautify.
- [ ] Link to SQL database.
- [ ] export and import decks
- [ ] network
	- [ ] browse and pull decks from remote server
	- [ ] share your decks on server
	- [ ] comment, star decks on server

Hope I can do it well this time. Thank you for reading this.
